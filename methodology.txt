<------------------------------------------- Hackerone Bounty Pipeline ----------------------------------------->

a) Recon Phase
    1)Get all the programs with bounties from hackerone program directory. Then filter all the ones and capture wild card ones to be bruteforced. Check agains the tag if it is eligible for a bounty even a minimal is fine to increase the reputation
    2)Now conduct research and sortout the best lightweight bruter forcer for domains
    3)Convert existing functions into golang code
    4)Now add the wrappers for remaining tool set as well to control them from golang. Also keep a reminder to control gomaxprocs to reduce cpu usage and memory max to peak while using amass
    5)Now run the code through these piplines which are proven to be best for Now
        Sublist3r, amass, gofinder, ctlogs list, fbcrtsh, crtsh
    6)Add the other tools to be explored to this list for a stronger Recon
    7)For every domain found check for wild card domains and repeat the necessary tool like bruteforcer and add  the juicy stuff to the list of final output
    8)Now separate them in the output to nx domains, cnames and ip ones. Check for errors related to ip and cname resolution as well
    9)Change the output folder structure to facilitate the entire process

b)Discovery
    1)Collect all the known ip's from the output and perform a mass scan omn them with a list of top ports
    2)If possible fire shodan query for every ip and figure out open ports with the scrape content
    3)Open all the found urls with eye witness and screenshot them
    4)Utilize the archive.org project for the prev gathered info and extract out other required details from that.
    5)Findout a way to utilize wapplyzer and other cms equivalent to identify the tech stack behind
    6)Use dirbuster and figure out other stuff

c)Exploits:-
    1)Endpoint seach for activator endpoints like spring boot
    2)Try to exploit password reset vulns headers
    3)Cloud instance metadata wrt aws and other cloud vendors


d)Misc:-
    1)Setup to findout JWT with no signature Setup
    2)Setup to search through website and get cors policy, data from csp headers, data from robots.txt and check header reflection in cors headers
    3)Scrape the website ans get all the assets and run through jsparser and evaluate the quality manually
    4)Target with special focus on image upload vulnerabilities with sepcial focus on xxe and image magik to exploit previous know ones
    5)Try to automate sql injection through every parameter
    6)Try to automate xss through known tools
    7)Try to use paraminer, backslash scanner and httpsmuggler in the Pipeline
    8)Make out best wordlist with small, medium and larger size with all the posible data and more custom in terms of password related stuff
    9)Also focus on ffmpeg related vulns and try to automate them

ALl these ones before trying have own setup done and try to exploit them then   :))Happy Hacking((:
